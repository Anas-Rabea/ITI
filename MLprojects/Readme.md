### Head Pose estimation Project

In this project I have used dlib Library to get 68 points of landmarks of face and 
using my model to determine which direction the person looks to.

First, I extracted the data from mat files alredy existed, link in notebook, of 68 points and yaw , pitch and roll of each file.
secondly , trained the model on data extracted and validate my work on different images.
lastly, I tested my model on live video to make sure it's working correctly and efficiently.\
